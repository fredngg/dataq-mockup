Overview
This project is a modern, responsive, single-page website mockup for DataQ, a company specializing in database solutions, data platforms, governance, and AI automation. 

The entire website is self-contained in a single HTML file, leveraging Tailwind CSS via a CDN and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure and content of the website.
Tailwind CSS (v3): Utilized via a CDN for all styling, enabling a modern, utility-first design approach without the need for a separate CSS file or build step.
JavaScript (ES6+): Vanilla JavaScript is used for all client-side interactivity, including:

- Mobile menu toggle.
- Sticky header appearance.
- "Before & After" slider functionality.
